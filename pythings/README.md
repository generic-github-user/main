# pythings

This is a small module resurrecting some old experiments of mine taking
advantage of Python's highly dynamic runtime, namely to bridge the gaps between
code written for functionality, testing, and documentation. Python's semantics
enable quite extensive metaprogramming capabilities without necessarily
resorting to syntactic macros; the language also has many tools that permit us
to extract useful information embedded in code without needing a separate
parsing tool.
