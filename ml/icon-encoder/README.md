# icon-encoder

This project is an implementation of an autoencoder neural network (as well as my first project with [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) for Python). It is designed to condense images of website favicons down to a small set of latent variables and then reconstruct these variables into an approximation of the original image. Once a high-dimensional representation of the training data is learned, novel images can be generated by randomizing the latent variables. Also see [my implementation](https://github.com/generic-github-user/TensorFlow.js-VAE) of a variational autoencoder in [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/).
