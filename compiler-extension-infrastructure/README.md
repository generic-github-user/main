# C, etc. Compiler Extension Infrastructure Project

This is a currently unnamed project that aims to provide reusable, modular
components for extending the syntax and semantics of C-like programming
languages via macros (source code transformations), metaprogramming and
static/dynamic analysis libraries & toolkits, and other composable units in
order to permit extreme, Lisp-style language customization while retaining
ideal performance and compatability characteristics. The intended end result is
that you can shape your language and its tooling to function exactly how you
want them to while incurring minimal performance overhead at runtime or
decreased maintainability. Furthermore, seamless transpilation enables you to
experiment with different programming paradigms and language-level refactoring,
and to work on existing codebases in a way that works well for you. It should
go without saying that this project is in the *very* early stages of
development, and is not yet fit for any real-world application; nevertheless, I
encourage anyone who is interested to download and play with the components I
have built so far.
