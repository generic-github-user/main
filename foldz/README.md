# FoldZ
> A system for computational origami with Python


`FoldZ` is a Python toolkit for multipurpose computational origami/[mathematical paper folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_paper_folding). It is intended to be as flexible as possible (pun intended), placing as few rigid constraints or domain-specific restrictions on its applications as is feasible. It provides functions for simulating and rendering folding of linkages, paper, etc. in both analytical and artistic contexts. The project is inspired by (and some of the included algorithms are based on) Erik Demaine's brilliant [lectures on Geometric Folding Algorithms](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall20/). It was difficult to find an existing system with a comprehensive and consistent API (and reinventing wheels has become somewhat of a hobby of mine as of late), so I decided to create `FoldZ` (the Z is meant to differentiate this library from the [FOLD file format](https://github.com/edemaine/fold)). Current or planned features include:

- Classes and methods for common operations on linkages, 3D origami, and similar geometric objects
- Compatible symbolic and numerical processing modes
- Rendering foldings to SVG images and other formats
- Tools for constrained optimization over origami foldings
