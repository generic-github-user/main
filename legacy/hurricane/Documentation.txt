To use Hurricane:


Place the "Hurricane.js" file in the same folder/directory as your HTML file.
Then place this code in the "<body></body>" section of your HTML: <script src="Hurricane.js"></script>. This references the JavaScript file that contains Hurricane. See the "example.html" file for an example usage of Hurricane.


There are two functions that can be used with Hurricane: train( ) and run( ). 

train( ) accepts 5 arguments: inputCount, hiddenNodesCount, mutationSize, accuracy, and trainingData. trainingData is an array filled with integers or floating point numbers, and the other 4 parameters are integers (mutationSize and accuracy can be a float). This is what the function looks like with blank parameters: train(inputCount,hiddenNodesCount,mutationSize,accuracy,trainingData). With values filled in the function arguments/in actual code, it looks like this: train(9,5,1000,0.1,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10]);. This function must be called before run( ). This function trains the neural network for use based on a given set of training data. It takes much longer than run( ), but it only needs to be run once.

run( ) accepts only one argument: inputValues. This is an array filled with integers or floating point numbers. This is what the function looks like with blank parameters: run(inputValues). With values filled in the function argument/in actual code, it looks like this: run([20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]);. This function can be called whenever the neural network has to be reevaluated with new inputs. It runs much faster than train( ).
