# lyre

lyre is a weird, wonderful little language that takes heavy inspiration from
lisp, most notably in its minimalism and homoiconicity. It also draws on Rust,
Julia, Python, Nu, and Bash, among a handful of other languages. My main goal
was to create a language that is as elegant, expressive, and generic as lisp
but less verbose and easier to write code that is stylistically compatible with
multiple programming paradigms.
