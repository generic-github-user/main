# lyre

This is a draft specification of the lyre programming language, meant to aid in
its design and development (particularly the reference implementation, which is
currently being written in Rust). Further changes should be anticipated,
including significant and backwards-incompatible alterations to the language's
syntax, semantics, and standard library functions.
