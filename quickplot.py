# QuickPlot contains cleaner and more coherent versions of some functions I commonly use for rapid multidimensional data visualization based on Matplotlib/Pyplot. The idea is to be able to display most types of data with 1-2 lines of code by handling boilerplate and automatically inferring which strategy is preferred for plotting a specific dataset; along with providing an interface to customize the generated plots at multiple levels of abstraction. The tools are mainly NumPy-focused and I am writing this mainly for my own use, so support/stability is not guaranteed.
