# Keyboard Dynamics

This repository contains scripts for analyzing the physical dynamics of typing using keyboards, and integrates elements of combinatorics, human-computer interaction, and several other topics. It takes inspiration from NIST's [PasswordMetrics](https://github.com/usnistgov/PasswordMetrics) repository, which quantifies the tradeoffs between ease-of-use and security in authentication systems.
