# shelf

Shelf is (my latest attempt at) a highly flexible notes aggregation, management, archival, and analysis tool. It provides parallel APIs using Python scripting and an efficient command line interface. The former allows for effortless extensibility and cooperation with your existing infrastructure, and the latter for ease of use and efficiency.

## Features

Features that have been implemented, are currently under development, or are planned. Note that some of these are tentative and may not appear in future versions.

- Create, edit, and delete notes
- Organize using a flexible tagging/categorization system (and optional hierarchical organization)
- Search for notes using regular expressions, fuzzy matching, etc.
- Automatic aggregation, syncing, and versioning of notes from various sources
- Visualizations of the relationships between notes, terms, tags, and more
- Efficient tools for manual and/or semi-automated ranking and sorting of notes according to various criteria
- Fully featured Python scripting API
- Export notes to Markdown and other human-readable formats
- Generate statistics from sets of notes
- Automatically maintain your notes library with custom scripts and actions
- High backwards-compatibility and longevity; all pertinent metadata is stored so that properties can be re-computed at any point in time
