# shelf

Shelf is (my latest attempt at) a highly flexible notes aggregation, management, archival, and analysis tool. It provides parallel APIs using Python scripting and an efficient command line interface. The former allows for effortless extensibility and cooperation with your existing infrastructure, and the latter for ease of use and efficiency.
