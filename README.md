# micronotes

## Requirements

None! micronotes was designed to work without any dependencies or requirements of any kind - just drop it into your web page, and it'll work. One of the issues I had with some other JavaScript footnote plugins and libraries was that they needed [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or other libraries to be loaded in order to work. Something as simple as adding footnotes to a web page should not require entire libraries - it should be simple, lightweight, and independent.

## Issues

Please submit any and all issues you have with micronotes to the [issues page](https://github.com/generic-github-user/micronotes/issues). I'll try to help you resolve it as soon as possible, or recommend an alternative solution if necessary.

If you want a feature added, submit that to the issues page too. I can't guarantee that everything people ask for will be added, but I'll read everything you submit.
