# packings

This is a tool to aid in investigating some ideas in combinatorics that I recently became interested in; namely, polyominoes and plane tilings. These basic structures naturally yield quite a few intriguing questions relating to enumeration/counting, optimization, categorization, etc.

The version of the program I am actively developing is written in C, primarily because the dynamic features of a language like Python no longer seemed to outweigh the importance of computational efficiency for a simulation program like this for me.
