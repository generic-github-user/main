# # Punchcard

# ## Introduction

# This toolkit provides flexible and efficient data structures that abstract common manipulations, providing mappings, serialization, restructuring, convenience methods/wrappers, memoization, and more. Numerous convenience methods and data processing utilities are integrated into the class and universally accessible.
# 
# The core motivation is reducing the headaches often faced when iterating (and executing functions) over deeply nested and/or irregular data structures, which often results in boilerplate code and poorly standardized/optimized subroutines. The tools included in punchcard aim for brevity, intuitiveness, and developer productivity.
