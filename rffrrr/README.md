# rffrrr

*really f---ing fast ray-tracing rust renderer*

rffrrr is an experimental 3D rendering toolkit written in Rust. It aims to
eventually support all the standard features one would expect in a complete 3D
creation suite, including 3D mesh representation, surface and volumetric
rendering, versatile lighting options, denoising and performance profile
customization, and many other useful features.
