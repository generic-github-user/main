# not-python

This is a customized dialect of the Python programming language which enables
some more extreme syntactic extensions by partially re-implementing the Python
parser such that new tokens and structural constructs can be introduced. Its
regex-based predecessor can be found in `/python-experiments`; this version
aims to be significantly more robust. It is written in Python and transpiles to
Python, enabling an impressive degree of runtime flexibility.
