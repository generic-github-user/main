- geometry: >
    helper classes for geometry in Python that I've been copy-pasting
    around periodically for the last 18 months or so (and actually one of the
    main reasons for creating this monorepo)

- leetcode: >
    some of my solutions to programming problems from
    [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/)

- master: >
    main branch; other branches are merged into this branch frequently (the
    build script is usually executed on this branch after some changes have
    been accumulated from other branches)

- meta: >
    information about this repository itself (code statistics, file
    listings, issue metadata, etc.)

- metadata: >
    updating serialized metadata about projects and branches stored in this
    repository (scripts developed on /meta use this information)

- repo-import: >
    used as a base branch for `git-subtree` merges (a subbranch is usually
    created off of this one with the new content, then merged into /master)

- obfuscation: >
    code obfuscation tools repurposed from an old repository of
    mine

- pythings: >
    useful tools and scripts for the boring parts of Python (mainly
    writing tests, documentation, etc.)

- py-style: >
    revising Python code to comply with flake8 standards

- code-quality: >
    implementing improvements recommended by codefactor and other tools

- unicode-art: >
    scripts and command-line tools for generating diagrams,
    charts, and other materials using ASCII and/or Unicode characters

- graphs: >
    Python graph classes and functions that I find myself rewriting
    often for different projects

- packings: >
    polyomino tiling simulations (also see the source repository on
    my GitHub profile)

- wordle-variants: >
    various language-based guessing games

- nushell-testing:
    - >
        experiments with Nu/[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), including
        integration into other projects and scripts

    - nu-ocr: >
        a more compact version of the Python-based media cataloguer on /ao
        (mostly to get used to interacting with the filesystem and databases
        via Nushell)

    - nu-todo: >
        Nushell-based todo management for task lists serialized with YAML
