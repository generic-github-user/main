    "This is a list of (hopefully interesting) programming puzzles I created (mainly for my own enrichment) with solutions and brief explanations. I didn't want to place any strict restrictions on how the problems are to be approached, but there will be some occasional suggestions about possible variants you might want to try (e.g., finding an answer with a certain time/space complexity, using a certain data structure, etc)."
