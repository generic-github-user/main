A module for basic web-related functionality that can be extended to fit the
needs of your project. Current development plan includes a
[Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)-like interface for concise HTML
construction, styling, basic interaction, and related functionality.
Eventually, more advanced features suitable for developing web applications may
be included (though it might turn out that these are better left to external
modules).
