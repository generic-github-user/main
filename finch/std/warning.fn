docstring ""
A "less aggressive" error-like message, typically to the developer(s),
signaling that some function or API component is being used improperly (but not
in a way that causes the program to crash). Examples include using depreciated
APIs (or ones that are set to become depreciated) and not following best
practices when passing arguments to functions/methods or macros.
