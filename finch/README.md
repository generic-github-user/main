# finch

*Fast, good, and cheap*

Finch is a general-purpose, multiparadigm programming language that draws
inspiration from Rust, Lisp, and Python, among several other languages. It aims
to be a highly capable choice for both high-level and low-level projects
spanning many different applications; and to support a wide range of coding
styles and environments without sacrificing quality, efficiency, or developer
experience.

It is not yet ready for practical use; I aim to release the first stable
version of Finch by January 2023 (subject to change). My goal is to have a
reasonably complete reference implementation in Rust within the next few
months, though further (substantial) changes are still a possibility ater that
point.

My hope is for Finch to be usable (and enjoyable) in all of the below settings,
among others:

- Systems programming
- Scripting and automation
- Mathematics (both numerical and symbolic)
- Application programming
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- Statistics
- Text processing and data science
- Web development
- Markup and templating

That said, there are certainly many areas where it *doesn't* aim to act as a
replacement for any existing standards; for example, the current Finch design
plan includes a fairly substantial runtime, so a compact and fully compiled
language like Rust might be a better choice for embedded applications.

**Note**: the master/main branch is pretty boring at the moment since the language is in a very early development phase, where core features are being designed, implemented, tested, and documented; I encourage anyone whose interest was piqued by the above description to take a look at some of the other [branches](https://github.com/generic-github-user/finch/branches).

## Branches

- `master`: The main branch, where stable versions of Finch will be tagged and released from (though most likely not until several months from now)
- `parser`: The reference implementation of the Finch parser, which is meant to conform (more or less) to the grammar outlined on the `specification` branch
- `specification`: Grammars, diagrams, natural language descriptions, and other materials outlining my vision for Finch that will (ideally) guide development of the parser and runtime
- `cpp-runtime`: A dynamic C++-based reference implementation of Finch, the development of which is helping establish reasonable goals for metaprogramming support, optimization, etc.
- `meta`: Information about this Git/GitHub repository, particularly that which is not applicable to the language itself
- `dev`: A multipurpose development/staging branch where nearly complete features will be merged prior to integration into the main codebase (on `master`; i.e., the stable line)
- `grammar`: A draft grammar for Finch written in [extended Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (newer iterations of the language necessitate a context-sensitive language, but most of the constructs can still be represented in EBNF)
- `stdlib`: The Finch standard library, which is in (very) early development; it is modeled loosely after those of Python and Rust (as well as some *de facto* standards like NumPy that are consistent and stable enough to be considered part of the language for most purposes)
		- `std-docs`: Tools for processing documentation (comments, examples, etc.) and generating markup
		- `std-collection`: Type-generic collections, objects that group other objects; planned submodules include support for arrays, hash tables, linked lists, sets, trees, graphs, and other structures
		- `std-error`: Errors and exceptions; items in this module generally terminate execution since they arise in situations where the process cannot safely recover from whatever has gone awry
		- `std-testing`: Utilities for unit testing and integration testing, fuzzing, static analysis, and potentially other related tasks
		- `std-warning`: Base types for generating alerts about potentially undesirable usage/side-effects in your code
		- `std-meta`: Tools for reflection and metaprogramming (parsers, AST manipulations, etc.) implemented in Finch itself; not to be confused with `meta`
		- `std-web`: Types and functions for basic web templating
