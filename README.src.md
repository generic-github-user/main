An experimental [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) for some of
my projects. Most of the existing projects that I've cloned into this
repository will continue to be developed independently in their corresponding
repositories, but I'm hoping to ameliorate some of the code duplication issues
and other maintenance headaches I've run into recently.

## Branches

- `geometry`: helper classes for geometry in Python that I've been copy-pasting
	around periodically for the last 18 months or so (and actually one of the
	main reasons for creating this monorepo)
- `leetcode`: some of my solutions to programming problems from
	[leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/)
- `meta`: information about this repository itself (code statistics, file
	listings, issue metadata, etc.)
- `obfuscation`: code obfuscation tools repurposed from an old repository of
	mine
- `pythings`: useful tools and scripts for the boring parts of Python (mainly
	writing tests, documentation, etc.)
- `unicode-art`: scripts and command-line tools for generating diagrams,
	charts, and other materials using ASCII and/or Unicode characters
- `graphs`: Python graph classes and functions that I find myself rewriting
	often for different projects
- `packings`: polyomino tiling simulations (also see the source repository on
	my GitHub profile)
- `wordle-variants`: various language-based guessing games
